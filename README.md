Customisable Web Socket Client
This is a minimal wrapper around websockets. This project's intended purpose is easing the process of writing 3rd party clients for existing applications or simply giving more control to newly-written js-websocket apps by wrapping the most important features of websockets like send function and onmessage listener. Wrappers allow you to add any check, apply any modification before actually using these features. In a sense, this is a websocket MITM tool. However, if you really need a websocket MITM tool, check my repositories.
